    <p>
      I'm a Swede living in Tokyo. Here, I'm part of the
      <a href="https://bento.me/kizunacollective" target="_blank">kizuna collective</a>
      core team, which is working on building a social community for authentic
      connection and sharing in the city. I am also
      working on the narrative-driven game project
      <a href="https://github.com/douglasdriving/The-Fourth-Wall" target="_blank">The Fourth Wall</a>.
    </p>

    <h3>Background</h3>
    <p>
      I was born and raised on Swedenâ€™s west coast outside the city of Gothenburg. After graduating university in 2020,
      I left
      my home country to seek new perspectives abroad. I lived in Berlin, Bangkok, Seoul, Buenos Aires, and Mexico City
      for a
      couple of months each. After 2,5 years as a nomad, I desired the opportunity to build connections over a longer
      time,
      and decided to move to Tokyo.
    </p>

    <h3>Work</h3>
    <p>
      I studied a five-year bachelor+masters program in engineering, specializing in design and product development.
      Since
      graduation, I worked on services, products, games, and systems. I have done product management, user research, UX
      design, product design, coding (front-end, back-end, and games), and user testing. I have worked in fields
      including
      fitness tech, educational tech, gamification, AR, online games, social welfare services, and community building.
    </p>
    <p>I am currently looking for work in Tokyo.</p>
