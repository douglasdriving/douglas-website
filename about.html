    <p>
      I live in Tokyo, where I am looking for work.
      I'm part of the <a href="https://bento.me/kizunacollective" target="_blank">kizuna collective</a> core team,
      who are working on building a social community for authentic connection and sharing in the city.
      I am also working the narrative-driven game project
      <a href="https://github.com/douglasdriving/The-Fourth-Wall" target="_blank">The Fourth Wall</a>.
    </p>

    <h3>Background</h3>
    <p>
      I studied a 5 year bachelor+masters program in engineering, specialized in design and product
      development.
      Since then, I have worked on services, products, games, and systems.
      I have done product management, user research, UX design, product design, coding (front-end, back-end, and games),
      and user testing.
