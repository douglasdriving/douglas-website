    <h2>Ambition is my enemy</h2>
    <i>2024-11-28 (added)</i>
    <p>
      I dream about the future of me and what I might become if I try hard enough: a respected thinker, a genius
      creator, and a successful entrepreneur. Wherever and whomever I am, I can think about a future in which I am
      “better.” The ideal self always shifts forward.
      <br><br>
      This results in a constant gap between me and my ideal self, a distance that keeps telling me what I am now is
      insufficient. The dream is always bigger than reality, and reality always seems to lack something.
      <br><br>
      Never reaching the point of being enough drains me and breaks me down. I never get to pluck the fruit from the
      tree that I am growing and experience the joy of being who I am.
      <br><br>
      The solution cannot be to work harder, but to let go; of dreams, of the future, of ambition, and control. To focus
      on being instead of on becoming.
