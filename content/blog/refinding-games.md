There was a time in my life when games were by far the most fascinating thing the world had to offer. The sense of awe, wonder, and infinite potential their worlds would spark in me kept me completely immersed and made the rest of the world disappear momentarily.

But, like for so many others, this is no longer the case. The experience of playing flattens with each passing year, and it is now exceedingly rare, if not impossible, for games to spark that sense of wonder I remembered them doing in the past.

There are many logical explanations for this development:

- The fact that I am older makes me resonate with other aspects of the world other than what I did as a kid.
- I have played so many games and have grasped so many systems that it is difficult for a game to now present me with something new.
- Years of viewing games from the perspective of a designer has rendered me unable to sink into them without thinking critically about each aspect of their design
- Society's emphasis on productivity has conditioned me to instinctively deem anything without a tangible outcome a waste of time.

And so forth. The point here is not to analyze the causes. Rather, I want to recognize my current state for what it is and find a meaningful path forward.

It is tempting to conclude that games have played out their role in my life and are no longer worthy of my time or attention. To just throw them out altogether.

But this is not a feasible solution, as games keep finding their way into my life whether I want them or not, either through social pressure, marketing, or my own dreams and memories. It is also not a satisfactory conclusion because I refuse to accept that games could not have any value for me. It is a medium of infinite potential, a space where anything can be created, interacted with, and experienced, and the idea that I could have exhausted any possibility of gaining something from that medium strikes me as absurd.

So, the path forward must be one in which games continue to play a role in my life, a role I assume to be very different from what it was growing up. Finding the path means understanding what role that might be.

This is where I am stuck. At least partly. I sometimes hear promising whispers of games as art, as means of connection, as serious methodologies, as canvases for creativity. But nothing has yet emerged with the light and clarity I seek. Perhaps it never will. Because, more often than not, the world is less sensical than we wish it to be. The pain and confusion this path seeking leaves me with is the one through which I am writing this text, screaming into the void in hopes of answers or resonance.

If you hear my scream, please take it as an invitation to join me on this search.
