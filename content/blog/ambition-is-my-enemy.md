I dream about the future of me and what I might become if I try hard enough: a respected thinker, a genius creator, a successful entrepreneur. Wherever and whomever I am, I am able to image about a future in which I am more.

As I slowly crawl towards him, my ideal self moves forward. There is always a gap. A distance that keeps telling me that what I am now is insufficient. Reality is always lacking, never enough.

Never reaching the point of enough drains and breaks me down. I never get to pluck the fruit from the tree I am growing and experience the joy of being who I am.

The solution cannot be to work harder, but to let go; of dreams, of the future, of ambition, and control. To focus on being, instead of on becoming.
