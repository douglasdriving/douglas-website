I recently read Mark Fischer's 2009 essay "Capitalist Realism," and I want to make a small note here to summarize my takeaways and thoughts about it.

The essay suggests that capitalism has the power to penetrate and seep into every aspect of society and our lives, as it inherently aims to extract profit without care for where that profit comes from. Capitalism is abstract and tricky to examine because it is not a single thing but rather a tendency or dynamic that finds its way into everything.

Capitalism is powerful because it can perfectly function without an ideology. It is post-ideological. No one needs to believe in capitalism as a good political ideal for it to work. It only requires that people accept it as the current system we live under and play by its rules. It then takes care of itself.

Capitalism has grown dominant because there is no alternative ideology, resulting from a cynicism towards ideals as a concept that has emerged from postmodernism. Even if people disagree with capitalism and its consequences, they cannot fight it directly simply by disagreeing with its downsides. They need to offer an alternative, a new ideal for structuring society that is worthy of believing in and fighting for.

The way forward to the next paradigm, thus, is to bring back ideology and start imagining alternatives for how we can live together. Ideologies that make us want to believe in something again.

I am working on building this ideology for myself.
