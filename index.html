    <p>
      I am a human being with a desire to rethink, redefine, and rebuild how we live together in society. I
      believe
      the most important thing we can do is form ways to live authentic and connected lives in which all citizens feel a
      sense
      of belonging, community, and purpose. While I sometimes struggle to find (professional) ways to apply my skills as
      an
      engineer and systems designer to foster this transformation, I enjoy thinking up new ways in which technology can
      be
      part of it.
