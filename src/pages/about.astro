		<p>
			I'm a Swede living in Tokyo. Here, I'm part of the
			<a href="https://bento.me/kizunacollective" target="_blank">kizuna collective</a>
			core team, which is working on building a social community for authentic
			connection and sharing in the city. I am also
			working on the narrative-driven game project
			<a href="https://github.com/douglasdriving/The-Fourth-Wall" target="_blank">The Fourth Wall</a>.
		</p>

		<h3>Background</h3>
		<p>
			I was born and raised on Sweden's west coast outside the city of Gothenburg. After graduating university in 2020,
			I left my home country to seek new perspectives abroad. I lived in Berlin, Bangkok, Seoul, Buenos Aires, and Mexico City
			for a couple of months each. After 2,5 years as a nomad, I desired the opportunity to build connections over a longer
			time, and decided to move to Tokyo.
		</p>

		<h3>Work</h3>
		<p>
			I studied a five-year bachelor+masters program in engineering, specializing in design and product development.
			Since graduation, I worked on services, products, games, and systems. I have done product management, user research, UX
			design, product design, coding (front-end, back-end, and games), and user testing. I have worked in fields
			including fitness tech, educational tech, gamification, AR, online games, social welfare services, and community building.
		</p>
		<p>I am currently looking for work in Tokyo.</p>
