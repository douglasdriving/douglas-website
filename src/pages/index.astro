	<p>
		I am a human being with a desire to rethink, redefine, and rebuild how we live together in society. I believe
		the most important thing we can do is form ways to live authentic and connected lives in which all citizens feel a sense
		of belonging, community, and purpose. While I sometimes struggle to find (professional) ways to apply my skills as an
		engineer and systems designer to foster this transformation, I enjoy thinking up new ways in which technology can be
		part of it.
